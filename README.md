# SalQ

## 📌 Description
Managing the salary acquittance process in educational institutions is often a tedious, manual task involving spreadsheets, fragmented approvals, and paper-based workflows. These methods are prone to errors, lack transparency, and offer limited accessibility for faculty and administrative staff.

Key features include:
- Role-based interfaces for **Admin**, **HR**, and **Faculty**.

- Dynamic salary reports with filters and custom date range support.
- Secure authentication and role-based access control.
- Email notifications, audit logs, and digital signature support.
